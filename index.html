                <p>
                    <b>Sondheim and Seurat.</b> Two artistic giants, two very different mediums. One used lyric and music, and one used color and light. Both had a profound impact on their respective niches in the art community, and their legacies are sure to indure for many years. So how are they connected? Sondheim's great work: "Sunday in the Park with George" is based on Seurat's most famous painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," seen here in the background.

                   Sunday in the Park with George is one of Sondheim's most beloved creations. The musical follows the life of the artist George Seurat, and includes a love story that, while not based entirely in truth, speculates on Seurat's relationship with the prominent figure in his famous painting. Sondheim uses lyrics and music to craft a musical that was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, and has endured as one of the most influential musicals ever.

                    George Seurat's work 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte' was a revolutionary piece of work that used a technique called pointilism. In the mid-1800s this was not a popular way to paint, and Seurat's use of many dots to capture unique colors and ways that light hit objects was transformative and, like Sondheim's musical about Seurat, has continued to influence all kinds of art and artists.
